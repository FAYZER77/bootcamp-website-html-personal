    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
    <p>
      The foudational movie of the best fantasy trilogy ever made. The heart displayed in the extended version in particular is what
      makes the rest of the films worth sticking around for
    </p>
    <h3>There Will Be Blood</h3>
    <p>
      Slow paced character study that is as realistic as it is disturbing in it's examination of a character who is the
      personification of capitalism
    </p>
    <h4>Interview with the Vampire</h4>
    <p>
      A brave film for the era it was created due to isn't psuedo romantic undertones between men along with a brooding sensibility
      in reflecting on immortality.
